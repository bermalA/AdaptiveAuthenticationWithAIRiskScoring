# Adaptive Authentication Project

This project focuses on dynamically activating or deactivating Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) systems based on a risk score generated by a deep learning model. The system analyzes user login details and decides whether MFA should be triggered, enhancing both security and user experience.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic MFA Activation**: Adapts MFA requirements based on real-time risk scores.
- **Deep Learning Model**: A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model built with TensorFlow.
- **Web Integration**: The model is deployed in a web application using TensorFlow.js and integrated into a Next.js-based frontend.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user login and authentication securely.
- **Firestore Database**: Stores user data and session information for further analysis.

## **Technologies Used**

- **TensorFlow.js**: To deploy the trained model in the browser.
- **Next.js**: For the frontend interface.
- **Firebase**: For authentication and real-time database management.

## **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) dataset is preprocessed and features are engineered.
   - Features include IP details, device type, login time, region changes, etc.

2. **Model Deployment**:
   - A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is trained and converted to TensorFlow.js format.
   - It is integrated into a Next.js web app where it processes user input and generates a risk score in real time.

3. **Dynamic MFA Activation**:
   - Based on the risk score:
     - Low-risk logins bypass MFA or require minimal verification.
     - Medium-risk logins use push notifications or biometrics.
     - High-risk logins trigger strong authentication methods like hardware keys.

## **Installation**

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Firebase account

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/adaptive-authentication.git
   cd adaptive-authentication
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies including TensorFlow.js:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm install @tensorflow/tfjs@latest
     ```
   - Configure Firebase credentials in `.env.local`.
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

---

## **Usage**

1. Access the web application at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Log in with valid credentials.
3. The model evaluates login details and displays:
   - **Low Risk**: Direct access to the dashboard.
   - **Medium Risk**: Prompt for additional verification.
   - **High Risk**: MFA triggers stronger security measures.

## **Future Improvements**

- Expand the dataset for better model generalization.
- Introduce more advanced secondary authentication methods.
- Optimize the model for lower latency in real-time predictions.
- Add support for more complex user scenarios and attack patterns.
